In simple terms, the IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) is a distributed file storage protocol allowing a network of computers to store any arbitrary information in a robust and immutable way. Each computer on the network acts as a client and a server, allowing it to route and cache network requests for other clients. At beautiful labs, we ensure every asset linked with our NFTs are stored and secured on the IPFS.

#### Why IPFS is so special?

Peer-to-Peer file sharing has been around for years, why is IPFS so special in this space? IPFS has some useful features that make it stand out in the crypto space, leaving it today to be the most popular and common choice for the decentralized internet.

IPFS is Immutable: Data, once added to the network, is not able to be changed. Clients can verify the data they reviewed was non-altered. Updates can be published, but these will take the form of new files, never overwriting the old ones.

IPFS is duplication proof: Data is chunked and then stored and then hashed when added to the network, allowing duplicate data to map to the same nodes, and thus only one entry is created. Adding a new file to the network will take less storage as the network gets larger, assuming the file is relatively similar to others in the network.

IPFS is decentralized: The network can still function as nodes leave and join. Large numbers of nodes can be taken offline and the whole system will still be reliant. Attempts to take down information or censor files will be unsuccessful without the total destruction of every node on the network.

The key feature here is decentralization, To illustrate what a centralized vs distributed network looks like, there are some visualizations below. The key here is that in effect Facebook controls the first network, they are the absolute source of all truth on the network. On the second network, each node is no more important than the others.

#### Overview of IPFS

Before diving in, let’s establish a general overview of what IPFS does under the hood. As a node in the IPFS network, you establish connections to dozens of other nodes throughout the network and acts as a routing point for them. You call these your peers.

Since content is given a unique identifier (some 256-bit hash), and clients are also given identifiers, the entire network can form a tree. Every node is either a client or content. As a client, you maintain a group of peers in the form of a skip list. Knowing a few people on the other side of the network (whose ids are much different than yours) and many people close by (whose ids are very similar).

When asking for a piece of content, either because you want it or were asked for it by a pier, you can direct your search to those piers you know closest to the content id. On average, the request will converge in Log(N) time. Furthermore, on the content’s return journey, each node caches the data so that future queries are faster. Since data can never change, these caches are highly aggressive and help drive down network costs.

To then actually access the stored content you can either use a node running locally or route through an existing node by passing it the content ID. Ipfs.io runs it own node, try this link to see ipfs in action:

#### How content is stored in IPFS

Let’s next walk through how IPFS will store a specific file on the network. Firstly, we need to be running an IPFS node. Though IPFS is distributed, that doesn’t mean it’s free. For each file that is hosted, someone has to be the first node to host it. If it’s popular enough, other nodes will cache it and help relay it, but it needs to start somewhere. If a file is pinned it is guaranteed to be available on the network, if it is not pinned, it will continue to survive until it falls out of the systems cache. You can pay people to pin your file, but for the sake of this example, let’s assume you are doing it yourself.

Before pinning, the file is first split into chunks of defined size (256 KB). Each chunk is then individually hashed, generating a unique identifier for each chunk in some range (0 to 2²⁵⁶). Using a Merkle tree these hashes are combined together to generate one hash for the entire file. This hash is the content ID for that file.

Now we need to encode each chunk onto the network. Simply traverse the network for each chunk and find a neighborhood of clients who are closest to each chunk (by comparing the chunk ID & the client ID), informing them that you are a source for the given data. When they receive requests for the target data, they can come to you now.

#### Pinning

The content you want to store forever with yourself as a source is called “pinned”. Any node can pin anything it wants, providing it forever on the network. To guarantee a file is served, it must be pinned. If a file is not pinned, it can and will still flow through the network as it lives on in the caches of other nodes. But this is no guarantee. These caches are cleared periodically and a lack of incoming requests will lead to its loss.

#### Mutable Content

Immutable content is great, but there are use cases for mutable content. IPFS has a solution for this called InterPlanetary Naming Service. What this allows is a client node to host a directory where requests return the content ids of items in that directory. In effect, rather than a client requesting the network for a given content ID, clients first request a list of what content ids are the most up to date from your client node and then will look those up.

This can be much slower and lead to some issues in practice. The community at IPNS is working to improve this.

#### Overview

This has been a general overview, but there is so much more out there. I encourage you to reach out to us if you have questions, but you can rest assured the imsages and content linked with your NFT are just as secure as the NFT on the Ethereum blockchain itself!
